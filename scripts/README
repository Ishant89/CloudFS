1. How to setup your disks (SSD) in the VirtualBox setup?
=============================================================

First "cd" into the 'scripts/' directory and then run the following scripts in 
the order given below:

./format_disks.sh           (to create the SSD disk with ext4 file system)
./mount_disks.sh
./umount_disks.sh

If successful, you are ready to use the VirtualBox for your experiments.


2. Description of all the scripts
=================================

This "scripts/" directory contains the following scripts:

/*
 ********************************
 *** VirtualBox Setup Scripts ***
 ********************************
 */

[format_disks.sh]
    - To create the Ext4 file system on the SSD 
    - Usage: ./format_disks.sh

[mount_disks.sh]
    - To mount the SSD to appropriate mount points (passed as
      arguments to the script)
    - Usage: ./mount_disks.sh

[umount_disks.sh]
    - To un-mount the SSD from appropriate mount points (passed as
      arguments to the script)
    - Usage: ./umount_disks.sh

/*
 *******************************
 *** General Support Scripts ***
 *******************************
 */

[cloudfs_controller.sh]
    - This allows you to unmount, mount and remout the file system at the
      desired mount point and with the desired threshold
    - NOTE: this script uses fixed constants for three cloudFS parameters ...
            --- the process path (../build/bin/cloudfs)
            --- the SSD mount point (/home/student/mnt/ssd/)
            --- the Fuse mount point (/home/student/mnt/fuse/)
    - Usage: 
        ./cloudfs_controller.sh MODE <arguments-to-cloudfs>"
      where ...
        MODE is either m for mount, u for unmount, x for (unmount+mount)
